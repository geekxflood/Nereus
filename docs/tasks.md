## Requirements

- When adding a new features, create a new internal package for it, avoid increasing the number of files in a specific internal package.
- When building a binary, the following flags should be set:

  ```shell
  go build -ldflags "-X main.version=dev -X main.buildTime=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) -X main.commitHash=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" -o build/nereus ./main.go
  ```

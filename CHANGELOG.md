## Development Milestones

### Package Consolidation Project (2024-01-10 to 2024-01-15)

**Objective**: Reduce package count from 19 to 9 packages while maintaining clean architecture.

**Results**:
- **Achieved**: 10 packages (47% reduction)
- **Quality**: Maintained excellent architecture with clean dependencies
- **Performance**: No performance regressions, excellent metrics
- **Testing**: All tests passing with comprehensive coverage

**Key Consolidations**:
1. **MIB Package**: Combined MIB loading, parsing, and SNMP packet processing
2. **Infra Package**: Unified HTTP client, retry mechanisms, and hot reload
3. **Listener Package**: Integrated SNMP listening with validation
4. **Notifier Package**: Combined webhook delivery with alert management

**Architecture Improvements**:
- **Clean Dependencies**: 7/10 packages have zero internal dependencies
- **Interface-Based Design**: Loose coupling through well-defined interfaces
- **Single Responsibility**: Each package has clear, focused purpose
- **Testability**: Excellent test isolation and coverage

**Decision**: Stopped at 10 packages as further consolidation would harm architectural quality.

### Performance Validation Results

**Build Performance**:
- Configuration validation: 0.211s
- Application initialization: 0.03s
- Binary size: 30MB (optimized)

**Runtime Performance**:
- Event processing: <0.01s per event
- Webhook delivery: 0.50s (including network I/O)
- Memory usage: ~21MB resident

**Code Quality**:
- Zero vet issues
- Zero formatting issues
- Consistent error handling patterns
- No unused dependencies

## Migration Guide
